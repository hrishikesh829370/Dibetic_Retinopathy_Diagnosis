# Dibetic_Retinopathy_Diagnosis

# MOTIVATION

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision loss. The World Health Organization reports that more than 300 million people worldwide have diabetes (Wong et al. 2016). In 2019, the global prevalence of DR among individuals with diabetes was at more than 25% (Thomas et al. 2019). The prevalence has been rising rapidly in developing countries.

Early detection and treatment are crucial steps towards preventing DR. The screening procedure requires a trained clinical expert to examine the fundus photographs of the patient's retina. This creates delays in diagnosis and treatment. This is especially relevant for developing countries, which often lack qualified medical staff to perform the diagnosis. Automated detection of DR can speed up the efficiency and coverage of the screening programs.
